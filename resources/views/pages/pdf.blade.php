            What is the DWG “Learn and DO” System?
        </h1>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            “Learn and DO” is a unique commitment to learning and action. Substantial growth occurs
            when we learn and then act upon that learning. “Learn and DO” is a decision to learn, help
            others learn and commit to immediate implementation. The commitment to immediate action
            is made even before the learning begins. Will you commit today to “Learn and DO?”
            Exponential growth awaits you if you’re willing to act upon even a small part of what you learn.

            The Rearview Mirror, the Seat & the Windshield
        </h1><br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Also known as the Past, Present & Future: </h2>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Picture this…you’re driving this beautiful Ferrari. You’re working through the gears and
            increasing your speed. As your speed increases you hit 140, 150, 160 miles per hour. You cast
            your gaze on the side rear view mirror, your breathing is picking up and you’re beginning to get
            nervous. It’s really hard to drive the car at optimum speed concentrating on the rear view. The
            rearview mirror represents your past, the seat where you’re sitting represents your present and
            the view out the windshield symbolizes your future.<br><br>
            Many people spend their lives fixated on the rearview mirror, dwelling on what has happened
            to instead of focusing on what can happen for us. I challenge you to put the past in the past.
            Sure, the past is valuable, but it's time to shift your attention to the vast possibilities that lie
            ahead. Look out that windshield and envision the incredible future that awaits you, your family,
            and your business. Keep your eyes on the road ahead, and let’s press the accelerator!

            Defining Leader, Transformational and Transformational Leader
        </h1><br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Also known as the Past, Present & Future: </h2>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Webster's dictionary defines leader as “…someone with commanding authority and/or
            influence”. But here's the twist: authority and influence can be polar opposites. Commanding
            authority sounds like control, and influence recognizes the power to effect change without
            control.<br><br>
            That's why I believe that true transformational leaders are the ones who are constantly growing
            and improving themselves. They inspire others to do the same, creating a ripple effect of
            growth and character development throughout their team. A transformational leader can look
            behind them and see at least one follower who is not only growing but also becoming a leader
            themselves<br><br>
            So, let's redefine our understanding of leadership. At its core, a leader is someone who can look
            behind them and see followers, and a transformational leader is someone who can lead others
            to grow personally and professionally.

            Comfort Zone Physics
        </h1>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Ah, the comfort zone – it's cozy, it's familiar, and it's oh-so-tempting. But guess what? There's
            no growth in your comfort zone. It's like your favorite chair or your go-to pair of shoes –
            comfortable, but not exactly the recipe for success.<br><br>
            Here's the secret to comfort zone physics: every time you step out of your comfort zone, it
            automatically expands to include that new territory. And the more you step out, the larger your
            comfort zone becomes. So, if you want to experience personal and professional growth, you've
            got to make a conscious effort to step out of that comfort zone every day and explore
            uncharted territories.<br><br>
            Remember, the best things in life are waiting for you outside of your comfort zone. Challenge
            yourself, take risks, and embrace opportunities for growth. Trust me, the rewards will be well
            worth it!

            Understanding the Quotients for Transformational Leadership
        </h1>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            We all know of IQ - the iconic intelligence quotient. But have you heard about EQ? That's the
            emotional quotient, my friends! While IQ is well-established with its formal grading system, EQ
            is a bit more free-spirited. But here's the kicker: despite our best efforts to believe we're logical
            creatures, we behave emotionally most of the time. Our brain, the IQ part, plays referee and
            sometimes vetoes our emotional behavior. But guess what? Most of the time, our brain says
            "Go ahead, heart! You got this!" That's just how we humans tick.<br><br>
            Now, why am I blabbering about IQ and EQ? Well, they both play a crucial role in
            transformational leadership. But there's another quotient that's vital to your success: PQ, which
            stands for the people quotient. And let me tell you, whether you're in construction, accounting,
            logistics, retail, restaurant, or consulting, we are all in the people business. We rely on people -
            our employees, contractors, and partners - to provide exceptional products, services, and
            experiences to our customers. The more we understand our PQ, the more we can tap into our
            people-centric power and level up our leadership game!<br><br>

            Command Leadership vs. Transformational/Servant Leadership
        </h1>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Picture this: the classic command leadership style, just like the army. At the top of the pyramid,
            you've got the Commander-in-Chief - think the President of the United States. And below,
            there's the Joint Chiefs, the General Staff, the Officer staff, and finally, the enlisted staff. Orders
            flow from the top, and everyone down the chain better follow them or face some serious
            consequences.<br><br>
            Transformational leadership flips that pyramid upside down! In this type of leadership, YOU are
            at the bottom, empowering your team to help you achieve your vision. Your staff is at the top,
            followed by your management or executive level. It's all about supporting and uplifting those
            around you. So, whether you call it transformational leadership or servant leadership, it's all
            about empowering others to shine!

            The Concept of WOW
        </h1>

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            On a scale of 1 – 10, with 10 being the best, WOW starts at 11 and goes to infinity. It’s the rare
            air that’s “above and beyond” normal products, services or experiences. You're on a long-haul
            flight, everyone around you is preparing to go to sleep, and suddenly, a flight attendant appears
            out of nowhere and asks if you want a mattress. Yes, a mattress! Who would've thought? But
            that's what happened to me, and let me tell you, it was a game-changing moment, my friends.
            <br><br>
            This amazing flight attendant shows up with a four-inch memory foam mattress, wrapped in
            luxurious 103-count sheets. I mean, talk about attention to detail! As we continue our journey,
            we find ourselves in Dubai, the busiest airport in the world. Now, you may think clearing
            customs there would be a dreaded task, but guess what? We had something even more magical
            than a Disney World Fast pass – included in our ticket price! We bypassed the never-ending
            lines and sailed through customs with ease. It was like achieving the impossible!
            <br> <br>
            Finally, in Thailand, after traveling for a grueling 24 hours, we were exhausted. But as if by
            magic, a driver named Don Williams appeared and whisked us away to a luxurious hotel. It was
            the middle of the night, yet we were greeted with warmth and hospitality that truly made us
            say, "Wow!" These experiences made me realize the immense power of creating moments that
            go above and beyond expectations.<br> <br>

            When you deliver "Wow" experiences to the people you influence – whether they are your
            prospects, customers, team members, or even your own family – you are doing something
            right. These moments have the power to transform lives, build lasting relationships, and set you
            apart as a leader in your industry.

        <img src="{{asset('assets/images/image10.PNG')}}" alt="Missing image" style="width: 100%; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 60px;">

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            My gratitude journey started at the Entrepreneur’s Organization Global Leadership Conference
            in Bangkok, Thailand. A smart lady and now friend by the name of Gina Mollicone- Long was
            speaking during a break-out session. Gina is a Process Control Engineer by education and a
            trainer of Performance Coaches professionally. I was lucky to be in the audience when she
            talked about the role of energy and emotion in human performance. During her lecture, she
            proposed that humans perform at their highest level when they express or experience
            gratitude, and at their lowest level when they express or experience fear or shame. Little did I
            know that thought would completely change my life.
            <br><br>
            When we returned to the United States, I drove myself to our local Home Depot and bought a
            small, galvanized pail. It wasn’t heavy but it’s noticeable, it’s shiny, not easy to carry in your
            pocket and you can’t really hide it, the pail is about eight inches tall and eight inches across. I
            wrote the word “gratitude” on a piece of paper and dropped it the pail. I carried the pail
            everywhere with me. That pail became a physical reminder to me to be intentional about my
            gratitude practice. It sat in the passenger seat of my car, in my truck, on the desk in my home
            office, on the credenza in my actual office, and beside the TV when Sunday movies came on. I
            did this for six months. The pail was my physical reminder to practice gratitude The interesting
            thing about gratitude, is the more you practice gratitude the more grateful you become. After
            six months or so I made the decision, I was going to share my newfound gratitude with my
            Company Leadership Team.

        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            We started a weekly Gratitude Exercise called One Good Thing. Every Monday at nine in the
            morning, each member was given one minute or two to share One Good Thing. One Good Thing
            is a share of whatever a person is most Grateful from their business, family, or personal life
            from the previous week. It was awkward at first and took a while before people were
            comfortable enough to really share, but once they did, their stories were eye opening.
            <br><br>
            Two stories stand out for me. One of my teammates was a parent to a daughter who loved
            soccer. When it was his turn to speak, he said that he was grateful that his daughter finally
            introduced him to her friends. You see, my teammate had been attending his daughter’s soccer
            games week in and week out, but his daughter never acknowledged that he was
            there. Until one day, she did. That tiny moment made my teammates’ week.
            <br> <br>
            Another teammate was a new grandmother. We all knew that her daughter was pregnant, and
            that they were all excited for the baby. What we didn’t know was that the baby had been
            diagnosed with a congenital defect that increased his risk for not surviving to term. If he did
            survive to term, the doctor said that it would be likely that he would be stillborn. If he wasn’t
            stillborn, he would most likely die immediately after birth. When it was her turn to speak, she
            said that she was grateful that her grandson was born. Though he lived only an hour, she was
            grateful to meet her grandson, hold him and tell him she loved him. I thought I was going to
            teach my teammates about the power of Gratitude, and I learned so much more than I taught. <br> <br>

            Vision in Leadership is a multifaceted concept.
            <br><br>
            <b>Own your Vision.</b> It’s vital to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve. Visualize your
            goals, imagine every detail - how it looks, smells, and tastes. Seeing your vision is essential for
            truly believing in its possibility.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Bill Gates Vision – </b>“Put a computer on every desk in every home in the World.” Bill Gates,
            founder and genius behind MicrosoA, set out on a mission to put a computer on every desk in
            every home across the globe.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Steve Jobs –</b> User Experience. The visionary leader of Apple, may not have formally wriEen
            down his vision statement. However, he was maniacal about craAing an unparalleled user
            experience. Steve wanted technology to be intuiIve, powerful, and effortlessly accessible.
            <br> <br>
            <b> See things from the other person’s perspective.</b> Understanding the power of perspective is
            crucial when leading others. Adopting the mindset of those you seek to influence will help you
            cater to their needs and desires. By genuinely seeing things from their point of view, you will be
            more successful in connecting with and leading them. Remember, their perspective is the one
            that truly matters.

        </h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Clarity</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Great leaders are not only visionaries but also exceptional communicators. Clarity lies at the
            heart of effective communication. By expressing your ideas with absolute clarity, you ensure
            that your message is understood and embraced by others. Clarity is kind.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Tough Conversations</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            Tough conversations are an inevitable part of leadership. However, many entrepreneurs and
            leaders struggle to approach these conversations confidently, often leaving the recipient
            confused or uncertain. If you’ve thought twice about having a tough conversation with
            someone on a particular issue, you’re probably overdue for that talk.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Relationships Stand on Communication and Expectation</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">

            Building strong relationships requires effective communication and understanding of
            expectations. By practicing open and honest communication, we can create an environment
            where expectations are expressed, understood, met & surpassed.

        </p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> The Power of Over-Communication</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">

            As a leader, it is essential to go beyond basic communication and prioritize overcommunication. By
            proactively seeking to understand the expectations of your team,
            colleagues, and loved ones, you can address their needs and concerns more effectively. It’s
            probably more important to communicate to the point that people cannot misunderstand than
            just understand.

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> The Ripple Effect of Your Actions</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">

            As a leader, your actions speak far louder than words. In fact the scrams of your actions many
            times drown out the sound of your words.
        </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> Embrace the Power of Observation</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">

            People naturally observe and judge those they look up to, and as a leader, you are constantly
            under their watchful eyes, someone is always watching. It’s important to recognize that those
            around you are evaluating you based on what you do, not just what you say.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> Living Your Vision, Living Your Goals</h2>
        <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size:20px;">
            To lead authentically, you must walk the talk. Your vision and goals aren't just words on paper;
            they are a roadmap for your daily life. Embody your aspirations and lead by example, and you
            will create a powerful synergy that propels your team and yourself toward success. Let your
            actions harmonize with your words and watch your influence soar.

            Repetition becomes your superpower. Re-visit your goal, communicate and lead by example
            every day. Repetition can transform the way others perceive and engage with your ideas,
            turning you into an irresistible force for change.
